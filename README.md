# PS-AD-MassEnroll
Powershell script that automatically adds new users to active directory domain from a csv file

# Not very dynamic

Once run it will ask for the path to the csv file to use.
As it is right now the file will need the same rows i have and, if you wish to use it, make sure to change the domain in the code from mine to yours :)

## School work

This is school work which is why it's so hard coded to work only with my particular csv file, i might come back and make it better.
